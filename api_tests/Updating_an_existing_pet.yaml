# Comment describing the expected behavior or outcome for each scenario
# This test scenario is designed to verify the functionality of updating an existing pet's details.
# When a POST request is sent to "/pet/12345" with the form data {"name": "Fido Updated", "status": "pending"},
# the server should respond with a status code of 200, indicating a successful update.
# Additionally, the response body should contain the updated pet details with the same name and status as sent in the request.
